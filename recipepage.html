            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Take 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon oil in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon.</li>
                <li> Add 2 to 3 tablespoon water in parts and begin to knead to a firm dough. Do not make the dough soft as then it becomes difficult to shape the dumplings.

                    If required you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water.</li>
                <li> Cover the dough with a moist napkin or kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li> Finely chop the vegetables. You will need 1.5 to 1.75 cups of finely chopped veggies. You can also use a food processor to finely chop vegetables like cabbage, carrots, french beans.

                    Veggies like capsicum (green bell pepper), button mushrooms and spring onions (scallions) can be chopped with a knife.</li>
                <li> Heat oil in a thick bottomed frying pan or wok. Add ½ teaspoon of finely chopped garlic. Sauté for 2 to 3 seconds on medium-low heat.</li>
                <li> Add spring onion whites (2 small spring-onions which have been chopped finely). Stir and sauté for 10 to 15 seconds on medium-low heat.</li>
                <li> Add all the finely chopped vegetables.</li>
                <li> Increase the flame and stir fry the vegetables on a medium to high heat. If you have not used a thick bottomed pan, then sauté the veggies on a low to medium heat.
                    Sauté or stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Then add 1 teaspoon soy sauce, ½ teaspoon black pepper and salt as per taste.
                </li>
                <li> Continue to stir fry on a medium to high flame for 2 to 3 minutes more. Switch off the heat and add 1 to 2 tbsp of the spring onions greens.

                    Mix well. Check the taste and add more salt, pepper or soy sauce, if needed.</li>
                <li> The vegetable stuffing is ready. Let the stuffing cool completely.</li>
                <li> Divide the dough in two parts.</li>
                <li> Make a 7 to 8 inches log from each part. cut the log into equal slices.</li>
                <li> Shape into a ball of each dough piece and keep them covered with a moist napkin.</li>
                <li> Take each dough ball and on a lightly dusted board. Roll each dough ball into a thin circle of about 3 to 4 inches diameter.</li>
                <li> The edges have to be thin and the center has to be thick.</li>
                <li> Apply water with your finger tip or with a small pastry brush towards the circumference. This is an optional step.</li>
                <li> Place 2 to 3 teaspoons of vegetable stuffing in the center.</li>
                <li> Lift one side of the edge and start pleating.</li>
                <li> Begin to pleat the momos.</li>
                <li> Join all the pleats in the center.</li>
                <li> A pleated and shaped momos.</li>
                <li> Prepare all momos this way and keep them covered under a moist napkin until you are ready to steam them.</li>
                <li> Grease a steamer pan with some oil.</li>
                <li> Arrange them in the pan, keeping space between them.</li>
                <li> Steam them in an electric cooker or a steamer pan. You can also use idli pan or pressure cooker to steam.
                    Add 2 cups water in the pot or pan while steaming. 
                </li>
                <li> Cover and steam for 5 to 6 minutes till the outer dough becomes transparent. Don’t overcook as then the outer dough, becomes dense and chewy. The steaming time may vary upon the thickness of momos’ cover.

                    When you touch the momo then dough should not feel sticky to you. This means they are done and the momos will have a transparent look.</li>
                <li> Serve veg momos hot with momos chutney or red chilli-garlic chutney, spicy schezwan sauce or tomato sauce. They also go best with a spicy sauce and should be eaten hot.</li>
